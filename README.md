# [Project 1: Chronic Kidney Disease Detection and Prevention](https://github.com/klipetri/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Detection-and-Prevention.git)

•	Analyzed patient health data, environmental pollution (air and water) data, and food access data to determine factors that indicate and contribute to chronic kidney disease (ckd) in the US population. 

•	Performed EDA, PCA, t-SNE, and feature selection. Compared classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes to develop a model to predict chronic kidney disease from patient health data.

•	Created choropleth maps to visualize air and water pollution data layered on data for ckd prevalence with the US. Created correlations of food access and fast-food restaurant location data vs ckd prevalence data within the US.

• Desktop and Mobile Phone applications were created to provide access to the predictive model at the fingertips of physicians and patients.

# [Project 2: Wildfire Prediction](https://github.com/klipetri/Wildfire-Prediction.git)

• Computer vision project utilizing color satellite images of areas at risk/not at risk of wildfire to develop a Convolutional Neural Network model for prediction of areas at risk of wildfire occurrence. Optimization through transfer learning (Keras Applications VGG16 model) and hyperparameter tuning. Final model test accuracy of 93.3% achieved.

# [Project 3: Movie Review Classification](https://github.com/klipetri/Movie-Review-Classification.git)

• NLP of movie reviews (genre and positive/negative rating) using k-means clustering, classification models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive bayes, Random Forest), Recurrent Neural Networks, and LSTM models. Analyzed impact of different data preprocessing methods and regularization parameters such as TF-IDF, Doc2Vec, and Word2Vec.

# [Project 4: QA Chatbot](https://github.com/klipetri/QA-Chatbot.git)

• Question and Answer Chatbot was developed to automate answers to general questions from customers pertaining to travel to specific geographical locations. TF-IDF Vectorization and Sentence Transformers from Hugging Face were utilized and compared to build a model with the most desirable output.
