# Project 1: Chronic Kidney Disease Detection and Prevention

•	Analyzed patient health data, environmental pollution (air and water) data, and food access data to determine factors that indicate and contribute to chronic kidney disease (ckd) in the US population. 

•	Performed EDA, PCA, t-SNE, and feature selection. Compared classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes to develop a model to predict chronic kidney disease from patient health data.

•	Created choropleth maps to visualize air and water pollution data layered on data for ckd prevalence with the US. Created correlations of food access and fast-food restaurant location data vs ckd prevalence data within the US.

• Desktop and Mobile Phone applications were created to provide access to the predictive model at the fingertips of physicians and patients.
